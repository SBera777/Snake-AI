# Snake-AI
Reinforcement Learning + Neural Networks \
Just a 3 hours project while I was bored
Original Idea : https://github.com/python-engineer/snake-ai-pytorch 

Just uncomment whatever functionality you need 

Improvements :
- CUDA Support
- Lesser disk IO's
- Removed Long/Short Memory System
- Optimized Snake Inputs
- Option to run on GitPod (which has no display)
